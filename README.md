# Predicting_Algae_Blooms
Practice project

This case study will provide concrete illustrations of some basic tasks of data mining:
data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. For this
initial case study we have selected a small problem by data mining standards. Namely, we
are addressing the problem of predicting the frequency occurrence of several harmful algae
in water samples.

This research is taken from the book (Chapman & Hall CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Disc_230613_10235)
